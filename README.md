### WhatsApp Business API Configuration

#### Enable Voice Calls
Your WhatsApp Business phone number must be configured to accept voice calls[[2]](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/):

1. Go to your WhatsApp Business API dashboard in Meta Developer Console
2. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Phone Numbers** → **Manage phone numbers**
3. Select your phone number
4. In the **Calls** tab, enable "Allow voice calls" capability
5. Save the configuration

#### Configure Webhook
Set up your webhook endpoint in the Meta Developer Console[[3]](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/webhooks/):

1. Go to **WhatsApp** → **Configuration** → **Webhooks**
2. Set callback URL: `https://your-domain.com/`
3. Set verify token: `your_webhook_verification_token`
   - This token should match your `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` environment variable

5. In the webhook fields below, select: `calls` (required for voice call events)

#### Configure Access Token
